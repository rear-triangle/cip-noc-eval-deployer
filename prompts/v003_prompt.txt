You are evaluating whether a Canadian education program (CIP) is a reasonable educational pathway into a Canadian occupation (NOC).

This is a single-turn evaluation task. All required inputs are provided below.

Task
Decide whether completing the CIP program would reasonably prepare someone for entry into the NOC occupation.

Answer the question:
Is this CIP a valid educational pathway for this NOC?

Base your decision on:
- the typical knowledge and skills taught by the CIP
- the NOC main duties and employment requirements
- level alignment (e.g., certificate/diploma vs degree expectations)
- exclusions, mismatches, or missing requirements

Important rules
- You MUST choose exactly ONE label from the list below.
- Do NOT use only YES/NO.
- Do NOT ask for clarification.
- Do NOT request additional information.
- Do NOT restate the task.
- You must now perform the evaluation using the inputs provided.

Allowed labels (exactly one)
- "YES"
- "LEAN_YES"
- "UNSURE"
- "LEAN_NO"
- "NO"

Confidence (0.00 to 1.00)
This is NOT a probability.
It is your self-assessed strength of evidence for the chosen label, based on how directly the CIP content matches the NOC duties and requirements.

Use this rubric to select a value (you may choose any number within the range):
- YES:       0.80–1.00 (strong direct match; CIP clearly trains for NOC; level appropriate)
- LEAN_YES:  0.60–0.79 (plausible pathway with partial alignment or missing elements)
- UNSURE:    0.40–0.59 (mixed signals, insufficient specificity, or ambiguous alignment)
- LEAN_NO:   0.20–0.39 (mostly mismatch; only weakly transferable skills)
- NO:        0.00–0.19 (clear mismatch; CIP does not prepare for NOC)

Output format
Return ONLY valid JSON.
Do NOT include markdown, commentary, or extra text.

The JSON object must contain exactly these keys:
- label
- confidence
- rationale
- model_version
- prompt_version

Where:
- label is one of the allowed labels above
- confidence is a number between 0 and 1 with up to 2 decimals
- rationale is 2–5 sentences citing concrete aspects of the CIP and NOC
- model_version is a short string (e.g., "llama3:8b")
- prompt_version must be "{{prompt_version}}"

If the information is too vague or insufficient, choose "UNSURE" rather than forcing YES or NO.
