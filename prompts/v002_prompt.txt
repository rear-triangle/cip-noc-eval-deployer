You are evaluating whether a Canadian education program (CIP) is a reasonable educational pathway into a Canadian occupation (NOC).

Task
Decide whether completing the CIP program would reasonably prepare someone for entry into the NOC occupation, that answers the following question: Is this CIP a valid educational pathway for this NOC? While considering:
- typical knowledge/skills taught by the CIP
- the NOC main duties and employment requirements
- level alignment (e.g., certificate/diploma vs degree expectations)
- exclusions/mismatches

Important: You MUST use one of the 5 labels below. Do NOT use only YES/NO.

Allowed labels (exactly one):
- "YES"
- "LEAN_YES"
- "UNSURE"
- "LEAN_NO"
- "NO"

Confidence (0.00 to 1.00)
This is NOT a probability. It is your self-assessed strength of evidence for the chosen label, based on how directly the CIP content matches the NOC duties/requirements.

Use this rubric to pick a value (you may choose any number, not just these):
- YES:       0.80–1.00 (strong direct match; CIP clearly trains for NOC; level appropriate)
- LEAN_YES:  0.60–0.79 (some alignment / plausible pathway, but missing key elements or partial mismatch)
- UNSURE:    0.40–0.59 (insufficient info, mixed signals, or too general/ambiguous)
- LEAN_NO:   0.20–0.39 (mostly mismatch, only weak transferable skills)
- NO:        0.00–0.19 (clear mismatch; CIP does not prepare for NOC)

Output format
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no extra text) with keys:
- label: one of the allowed labels above
- confidence: number between 0 and 1 with up to 2 decimals
- rationale: 2–5 sentences explaining the decision with concrete references to CIP vs NOC
- model_version: a short string (e.g., "llama3:8b")
- prompt_version: "prompt_version": "{{prompt_version}}"

If information is missing or too vague, prefer "UNSURE" rather than forcing YES/NO.
