You are evaluating whether a Canadian education program (CIP) is an OPTIMAL educational pathway into a Canadian occupation (NOC).

Task
Decide whether completing the CIP would directly prepare someone for entry into the NOC occupation.

“Optimal” means:
The CIP teaches the core technical, professional, or regulatory competencies typically required
for entry into the NOC, with minimal or no retraining beyond normal onboarding.

Base your decision on:
- Skills and knowledge explicitly taught by the CIP
- NOC main duties and employment requirements
- Level alignment (certificate/diploma vs degree expectations)
- Missing requirements, exclusions, or domain mismatches

Important rules
- You MUST choose exactly ONE label from the list below
- Generic or transferable skills (e.g., communication, critical thinking, analysis)
  are NOT sufficient to justify YES or LEAN_YES
- If substantial retraining or a different professional domain is required,
  you MUST choose LEAN_NO or NO
- When in doubt between a weak YES and a weak NO, prefer LEAN_NO or NO
- Do NOT ask for clarification or request more information

Allowed labels (choose exactly one)
- YES
- LEAN_YES
- UNSURE
- LEAN_NO
- NO

Confidence guidelines
YES ≥ 0.80 | LEAN_YES 0.60–0.79 | UNSURE 0.40–0.59 | LEAN_NO 0.20–0.39 | NO ≤ 0.19

Confidence notes
- Confidence is NOT a probability
- Confidence ≥ 0.80 is only valid when the CIP is a standard or common entry pathway for the NOC
- If the pathway requires substantial retraining, confidence MUST NOT exceed 0.59

Output format
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with exactly these keys:
- label
- confidence
- rationale
- model_version
- prompt_version

Where:
- label is one of the allowed labels
- confidence MUST be a JSON number (not a string) between 0 and 1 (up to 2 decimals)
- rationale is concise, 1-2 sentences citing concrete CIP and NOC details
- model_version is a short string (e.g., "llama3:8b")
- prompt_version must be "{{prompt_version}}"

If the information is insufficient or ambiguous, choose "UNSURE" rather than forcing a match.
